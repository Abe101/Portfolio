          I am a Pakistani INTP self-taught developer mostly interested in
          front-end development. ðŸ‘‹
          <br />I am currently enrolled in the Sindh University for the
          Bachelors of Computer Science Undergratuate Study. Honestly speaking,
          I learned very less in classes than on my own. But taking a
          opinionative guess, I can tell that Universities are not meant to
          teach you how to get the task done, instead they try to carve out the
          Engineer in you. But I did not get that feeling from my university. I
          am not against the idea of joining colleges or any other medium of
          classes but I probably assume you are not here to hear that from me
          right now. ðŸ« 
          <br />I like to play chess in my free time and I am pretty much
          obsessed with Rubik's Cube. Like the puzzle in your hand that messes
          with your mind and once you get the hang of it you find yourself
          wanting to look at its science and math. I am also interested in
          astrophysics related stuff, Neil deGrasse Tyson is a hero of mine.
          <br />I love to code and learn new technologies, if you were to ask me
          what company I like the best among the software developers I would
          glady say Vercel. They are changing the face of industry by a mile. ðŸ«¡
